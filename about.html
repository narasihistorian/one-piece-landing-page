            <h1>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</h1>
            <p>
              Hey Gretting, let me introduce you into my project. Last weeks I
              found in the instagram @dailywebdesign about competition to build
              web Design with anime theme. So based on the anime genre, I decide
              to choose my favorite anime, One Piece as a theme which is I used
              into my Project. The storytellling about my project is simple, I
              just tell main character about Straw Hat crew which is main
              Character in the One piece World.
            </p>
            <p>
              My main tools for this project, I've using Figma to design
              wireframe and the structure my project, then I'm convert my design
              prototype into real world project using pure HTML, CSS, and
              javascript, GSAP and BarbaJS library to create interactive
              animation on my project.
            </p>

            <p>
              My style in this project I'm using Grid box mixed page transition
              for better user experience and put interactive, simple and visual
              pleasing assets which already responsive on fullHD (1920px),
              desktop (1280px), Tab (1024px) and Mobile (720px). Less perfect
              actually, stil have minor bug but Hopely you enjoy with my
              project.
            </p>

            <p>
              Best Regard :

            <p>
              Unlike any other. Luffy is a young adventurer who has longed for a
              life of freedom ever since he can remember. He sets off from his
              small village on a perilous journey to find the legendary fabled
              treasure, ONE PIECE, to become King of the Pirates! But in order
              to find the ultimate prize, he’ll need to assemble the crew he’s
              always wanted before finding a ship to sail, searching every inch
              of the vast blue seas, outpacing the Marines and outwitting
              dangerous rivals at every turn.

              Luffy does not seem to mind if someone he wants to recruit has a
              profession or not. He allowed Usopp to join, and later on names
              him the team's sniper, and considered Vivi and Karoo members even
              though her only "profession" would be a princess. Luffy's tendency
              to ask people who interest him to join often led him to attempt to
              recruit bizarre creatures into his crew at a whim (such as
              Chopper, Brook, Unigaro, MocDonald, and Kin'emon's severed legs;
              the latter three never joined the crew eventually), which would
              annoy the rest of the crew, prompting them to snap at him to stop.

            <p>
              If a Straw Hat crew member leaves the crew without Luffy's
              permission, Luffy does his best to recruit them back. So far,
              Nami, Robin, and Usopp have all chosen to officially leave the
              crew in the past, before returning. Additionally, Chopper and
              Sanji have been coerced by third parties to leave the crew against
              their wishes, with Chopper returning soon afterwards, and Sanji
              leaving for about a week.

            <p>
              While traveling, the Straw Hat Pirates have mostly just followed
              the route that their Log set out for them; the crew would travel
              from one island to another in order without backtracking or
              getting scattered by certain situations or forced to go off
              course—unless someone is taken away, the crew's visiting the
              island delays their voyage (i.e., partying on Conomi Islands or
              the national celebration in Arabasta), or leaving the Grand Line.
              It is not until Water 7 that things begin to shift from this
              'formula'; the crew had to leave Water 7 to Enies Lobby to rescue
              Robin.
