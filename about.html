                Unlike any other. Luffy is a young adventurer who has longed for
                a life of freedom ever since he can remember. He sets off from
                his small village on a perilous journey to find the legendary
                fabled treasure, ONE PIECE, to become King of the Pirates! But
                in order to find the ultimate prize, he’ll need to assemble the
                crew he’s always wanted before finding a ship to sail, searching
                every inch of the vast blue seas, outpacing the Marines and
                outwitting dangerous rivals at every turn.

                Luffy does not seem to mind if someone he wants to recruit has a
                profession or not. He allowed Usopp to join, and later on names
                him the team's sniper, and considered Vivi and Karoo members
                even though her only "profession" would be a princess. Luffy's
                tendency to ask people who interest him to join often led him to
                attempt to recruit bizarre creatures into his crew at a whim
                (such as Chopper, Brook, Unigaro, MocDonald, and Kin'emon's
                severed legs; the latter three never joined the crew
                eventually), which would annoy the rest of the crew, prompting
                them to snap at him to stop.

              <p>
                If a Straw Hat crew member leaves the crew without Luffy's
                permission, Luffy does his best to recruit them back. So far,
                Nami, Robin, and Usopp have all chosen to officially leave the
                crew in the past, before returning. Additionally, Chopper and
                Sanji have been coerced by third parties to leave the crew
                against their wishes, with Chopper returning soon afterwards,
                and Sanji leaving for about a week.

              <p>
                While traveling, the Straw Hat Pirates have mostly just followed
                the route that their Log set out for them; the crew would travel
                from one island to another in order without backtracking or
                getting scattered by certain situations or forced to go off
                course—unless someone is taken away, the crew's visiting the
                island delays their voyage (i.e., partying on Conomi Islands or
                the national celebration in Arabasta), or leaving the Grand
                Line. It is not until Water 7 that things begin to shift from
                this 'formula'; the crew had to leave Water 7 to Enies Lobby to
                rescue Robin.
